## General Information

This program is a program to determine the convex hull of a particular dataset. The purpose of this convex hull program is to find the 'outermost' set of points that make up the convex hull by using the quick sort method. <br/>Convex hull itself has quite a lot of uses, such as scanning an object, detecting outliers on the data sets, and useful in optimization problems.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9.7
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6
- Numpy Library 1.21.4
- Pandas Library 1.3.5
- Matplotlib Library 3.5.1
- Sklearn Library

## How to Use?

### Using Python Terminal

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/adellinekania/Tucil2-MyConvexHull
  ```
- Run python main.py file
  In the src/py folder
  $ py main.py
- Enter the input in the form of an integer with the range requested by the program

### Using Jupyter Notebook
